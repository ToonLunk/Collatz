# Collatz Conjecture

## The Author

This project is currently in progress; being written by Chase Brock. Started in August 2021.

## The Idea

The idea for this program came after watching a video about the Collatz Conjecture. I'm interested in weird/confusing mathematics, and wanted to give myself a way to visualize it. This program was originally created in Python and I created my own GUI using Tkinter to display the results, but I'm now switching to JavaScript since it's better at... looking prettier.
